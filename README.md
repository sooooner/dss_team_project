+ Goal
	* it is your job to predict the sales price for each house.
	* For each Id in test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.

+ Metric
	* submissions are evaluated in Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.(Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally)
